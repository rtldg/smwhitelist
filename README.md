# smwhitelist

this was created because serverwhitelistadvanced checks steam groups & ids very late. sometimes it never checks so players can join even though they're not in a whitelist group. great plugin.

this uses the connect extension (or PTaH on CS:GO) & also caches steamids from steam groups so we can check before the client actually joins the game and before the OnClientAuthorized forward triggers

## to use
create sourcemod/configs/whitelist.txt & fill it with steamids, ips, and group ids (an example exists at `addons/sourcemod/configs/whitelist.txt`)
